# Portfolio â€“ Part 4

This project involved a unique, open-ended task that required formulating our own analytical questions, conducting in-depth analysis, and documenting every step of the process. The goal was to combine technical machine learning techniques with thoughtful interpretation to uncover meaningful insights from data.

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project was intentionally open-ended, allowing us to select a dataset of our choice.  
Key objectives included:
- Formulating analytical questions
- Performing in-depth exploration and analysis
- Explaining methodologies and results
- Proposing potential improvements

This flexibility encouraged deeper engagement with the data and allowed for a broader scope of exploration.

## ðŸ”Ž Analysis
Our analysis followed a structured approach:  
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.  
2. **Model Implementation:** Applied a linear regression model first, then tested alternative models to improve performance.  
3. **Training & Testing Split:** Split the data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting and ensure generalisability.  
4. **Visualisation:** Used multiple techniques â€” including elbow plots, histograms, and scatter plots â€” to uncover patterns and support model evaluation.

## ðŸ§­ Exploration
The exploration process involved several steps:  

- **Library Import & Initial Exploration:** Loaded relevant libraries and reviewed the dataset structure.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed missing/null values to maintain data integrity.  
- **Categorical Encoding:** Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using **Ordinal Encoding** to ensure model compatibility.  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Calculated correlations between variables (e.g., life expectancy and GDP).  
- **Visualisation:**  
  - Scatter plots & histograms for distribution checks  
  - Bivariate heatmap to examine relationships between GDP and life expectancy  
- **Clustering:** Applied **K-Means clustering** to group similar data points by minimising intra-cluster variance.  
- **Model Training:**  
  - Implemented a **linear regression model**  
  - Conducted parameter tuning with **polynomial regression**  
- **Model Evaluation:** Measured performance using:  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**

## ðŸ“Š Conclusion
This project demonstrated how careful data cleaning, thoughtful model selection, and robust evaluation metrics can lead to meaningful insights.  

Key takeaways:
- **Improved Understanding:** Gained hands-on experience with regression models, clustering, and performance evaluation.  
- **Deeper Insight:** Identified key variables affecting life expectancy and their relationships to economic factors.  
- **Practical Value:** Reinforced the importance of combining technical skills with analytical reasoning to extract actionable insights.

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements
Potential enhancements include:
- Refining data visualisations for greater clarity  
- Experimenting with additional machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests)  
- Automating data cleaning steps for reproducibility  
- Performing cross-validation for even more robust model evaluation
