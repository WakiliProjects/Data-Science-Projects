Introduction: The task presented was unique in that it required us to formulate our own analytical questions, conduct in-depth analysis, and provide detailed explanations of our processes, methodologies, and potential improvements. This project was intentionally open-ended, allowing us to select a dataset of our choice. This flexibility enabled a broader scope of exploration and deeper engagement with the data.

Analysis: Our analysis began with cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. A linear regression model was initially applied, followed by the implementation of alternative models to assess and improve performance. To prevent overfitting and ensure generalisability, the dataset was appropriately split into training and testing sets. Throughout the process, various data visualisation techniques, including elbow plots, histograms, and scatter plots, were used to uncover patterns, illustrate relationships, and support our model evaluations.

Exploration: The process began with importing relevant libraries and conducting an initial exploration of the dataset. Data cleaning involved removing missing or null values to maintain data quality. Categorical variables were converted into numerical formats using Ordinal Encoding to ensure compatibility with machine learning models. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the strength of relationships between variables and life expectancy. Visual tools such as scatter plots and histograms were used to explore these relationships further. A bivariate histogram in the form of a heatmap was created to analyse the connection between life expectancy and GDP. K-means clustering was applied to identify and group similar data points by minimising intra-cluster variance. The dataset was then split, and a linear regression model was trained. A parameter analysis using polynomial regression was also performed to determine which model yielded the best performance. The final models were evaluated using standard metrics, including Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

Conclusion: While completing the project, we effectively leveraged machine learning techniques to uncover significant insights and patterns within the dataset. The process of cleaning data, applying models, and refining our approach enhanced our understanding of model performance and practical data analysis. Ultimately, this experience highlighted the value of combining technical methods with thoughtful analysis to derive meaningful conclusions from data.
