Analysis

The main objective of this project was to establish a training and testing model, which is a fundamental step in machine learning as it allows for the evaluation of a model's accuracy and performance. The dataset was divided into two sets: one for training and the other for testing. While the split can be done at various ratios, in this case, Case 1 used 10 percent of the data for training, and Case 2 used 90 percent for training, with the remaining data used for testing in each case.

Exploration

Using a linear regression model, we aimed to examine and predict how different features correlate with the rating variable. The first step involved exploring the dataset to identify key features such as helpfulness, gender, category, and review, and assessing their relationship with ratings.

The training and testing sets were then created using different percentage splits as outlined earlier. The regression model was applied in several cases, ranging from Case A to Case D, each covering either the two most correlated or two least correlated features with respect to the rating.

The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure error levels and assess model performance. A final graph was generated to visually compare each modelâ€™s predictions using MSE and RMSE values, helping determine which features had the strongest correlation with rating.

Additional Features

Comments were added throughout the code to help guide readers and explain the purpose of each step and the type of information being retrieved.

Challenging Tasks

One of the challenges I encountered was interpreting the task requirements and understanding exactly what was needed to complete the project. I also had to learn how to use new tools, such as the Ordinal Encoder, including understanding its purpose and how to apply it. Training and testing different models to ensure accuracy and reliability also required careful attention. Additionally, finding and applying the correct formula for calculating the Mean Squared Error posed a challenge due to the variety of available functions.

Improvements

Further improvements could include refining the appearance of the graph for better clarity, enhancing the code structure to improve readability, and revising some comments to ensure they clearly explain the logic and functionality of the code.
