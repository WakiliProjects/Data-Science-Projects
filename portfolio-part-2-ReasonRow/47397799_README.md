Project Overview

Analysis

The goal of this project was to establish a training and testing model — a key step in machine learning that helps evaluate accuracy and performance.

Case 1: 10% training data, 90% testing data

Case 2: 90% training data, 10% testing data

This allowed us to compare performance across different training/testing splits.

Exploration

We used a linear regression model to examine how features such as helpfulness, gender, category, and review correlated with the target variable (rating).

Training and testing sets were created with the splits mentioned above. Several scenarios (Cases A–D) were tested using either the two most correlated or two least correlated features.

Model performance was measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and results were visualized in a final graph for comparison.

Additional Features

Comments were added throughout the code to explain:

The purpose of each step

The type of data or output being generated

Challenges

Key challenges included:

Interpreting task requirements and clarifying objectives

Learning how to use tools like Ordinal Encoder

Carefully training and testing models for reliability

Applying the correct formula for MSE (given multiple available options)

Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

Making the final graph clearer and more visually appealing

Refactoring the code for better readability

Refining comments to make the logic easier to follow
