## Overview
This project contains a Qualtrics-built survey designed to explore how people enter and develop careers in data. The survey collects both quantitative and qualitative responses about roles, tools, experience, and motivations, with the goal of identifying common pathways, skill patterns, and career sentiment across different respondent groups.

## Research Focus
The survey explores:
- Current role and career background in data
- Tools and technologies used (e.g., SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, Tableau)
- Years of experience and career stage
- Types of data worked with (e.g., operational, customer, financial, public datasets)
- Interest in data and reasons for choosing the field
- Career change intentions and drivers
- Reflection on career choice (whether respondents would choose the same path again)

## Survey Design
The survey is structured into sections to improve response quality and analysis.

### Question Types Used
- Multiple choice (single select)
- Multiple choice (select all that apply)
- Likert scales (e.g., satisfaction, agreement)
- Ranking questions (optional, if included)
- Short text and long text responses

### Data Quality Controls
- Clear question wording and consistent response ranges for experience bands
- “Other (please specify)” options with required text entry
- Forced response validation on key questions to reduce missing values
- Logical flow from screening and background to reflective questions
