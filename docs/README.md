### Project Management Portfolio Highlight
This project demonstrates my ability to apply structured PMO governance, scope control, resource allocation and delivery discipline across a complex real world project. This case shows tangible impact, quantifiable delivery outcomes and the practical PM skills I bring into a PM / Junior PM / Project Coordinator role.

## Updated Project Management Portfolio Case – Virtual Agent Incident Reporting System (PNG)

### Project Overview
Delivered a Virtual Agent solution to support violent incident reporting in Papua New Guinea over a structured 10-week delivery window, implementing controlled project governance across 7 contributors. The initiative aimed to improve reporting speed, stakeholder visibility and reduce manual intervention delays by applying PMO-aligned frameworks.

### PM Responsibilities
- Drove scope, schedule and change control across 7 major deliverables using Gantt-based planning, weekly cadence reviews and milestone gates.
- Maintained a risk register with prioritisation and documented mitigation strategies to protect critical-path progress.
- Implemented structured versioning and documentation governance for all project artifacts to protect continuity and handover quality.
- Coordinated resource allocation, optimising team utilisation — D3 critical work represented 78% of total allocated hours (19.5 / 25 hours), ensuring high yield of effort vs time allocation.

### Delivery Results / Measurable Impact
- Reduced report processing cycle time by **80%**, improving stakeholder insight access to **under 5 minutes**.
- Workload balanced evenly across team, achieving **30.75 total recorded hours** in D4 with no overload concentration.
- Feasibility assessed for **30,000+ potential end users** to support future scalability and market need.
- **100%** on-time completion of scheduled deliverables within resource constraints and without scope slippage.
